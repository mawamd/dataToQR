# dataToQR
sample HTML form that saves the information as a QR code

Do you ever get tired of answering the same questions over and over?
Or worse -- it's the same question but you can't remember the answer when the next person asks?
Sometimes it's important stuff, like what medicines you're taking, or the last time you touched grass!

If it's a standard question, then you're in luck!
Ask your interrogator to create a questionnaire using the code below -- Then, answer once and for all and snap a picture of the QR code!

Next time someone asks, you can just show them your QR code :-)
